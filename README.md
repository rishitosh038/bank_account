## Overview
This project demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python** through a real-world **Bank Account Management System**.  
It uses classes, objects, encapsulation, inheritance, and method overriding to simulate basic banking operations.

This project is **interview-ready and production-structured**.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python 3.x  
- VS Code (or any Python IDE)

## Objectives
- Understand Object-Oriented Programming concepts
- Implement classes and constructors
- Use encapsulation for data security
- Apply inheritance and method overriding
- Create multiple objects
- Simulate real-world banking operations
- Write clean, structured, and reusable code

---

## OOP Concepts Covered
- Class and Object  
- Constructor (`__init__`)  
- Encapsulation (private variables)  
- Getter and setter methods  
- Inheritance  
- Method overriding  
- Multiple object creation  
- Real-world problem modeling  

---

## How the Program Works
1. A base class `BankAccount` defines common properties and methods.
2. `SavingsAccount` and `CurrentAccount` inherit from `BankAccount`.
3. Encapsulation protects sensitive data like balance and account number.
4. Method overriding customizes behavior for different account types.
5. Multiple bank accounts are created to simulate real banking scenarios.
6. Operations such as deposit, withdrawal, and interest calculation are performed.
